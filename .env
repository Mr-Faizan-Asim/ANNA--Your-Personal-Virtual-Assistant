        Although I did not know English well (like most Italians), I made myself understood and appreciated, as you can see from the reviews and I will tell you more I was also included on Tripadvisor among the Best "World" Gastronomic Experiences and I am the fourth in the world.

        * ATTENTION: CONTACT ME FIRST ! Especially for special requests.

        Seeking the most authentic Roman cuisine?

        Want to surprise your significant other or celebrate a special occasion?!

        Whether you’d like to help side-by-side prepare the meal with me, your personal chef, or you’d like to walk through the door to find a fully prepared dinner waiting for you, I will be happy to accommodate your request. No matter how small or unequipped the kitchen is at your place!

        The experience requires no effort on your part. From shopping to prep to cleaning up afterwards, I’ll take care of everything and will make sure this will be one of the most memorable food experiences during your Roman Holiday.

        Savour a traditional 4-course Roman meal prepared by your personal chef. Start the feast with an antipasto, followed by a classic pasta course, and then traditional Roman meat course. End the evening on a sweet note with a traditional crowd pleaser, tiramisù.

        The whole meal can be accompanied by an excellent bottle of Italian wine upon request.
